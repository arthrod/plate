/**
 * The Buffer constructor returns instances of `Uint8Array` that have their
 * prototype changed to `Buffer.prototype`. Furthermore, `Buffer` is a subclass of
 * `Uint8Array`, so the returned instances will have all the node `Buffer` methods
 * and the `Uint8Array` methods. Square bracket notation works as expected -- it
 * returns a single octet.
 *
 * The `Uint8Array` prototype remains unmodified.
