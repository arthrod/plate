re("util");eld_implementation_diffs/ conrc/lib/mammoth.js/dist/cjs/index.cjs:601:31 ]ainsss all diffs from the browsified mammoth_before_refactoring. however, due to the browqsification, there were some changes in the name of the functions that doesnt help us very well. in any case, for each file contained in mammoth_before_refactoring you will run a DIFF - not merely open them - save the diff in old_implementation_diffs with a descriptive name, e.g. mammoth_before_refactoring-mammoth-js-lib-document-to-html-js-v--lib-document-to-html-ts SUCH FILE MUST CONTAIN ONLY THE SUCCINT DIFF!! thenyou will make a list indicating what you found and what you didnt. whats missing and whats the diffs biggest changerc/lib/mammoth.js/dist/cjs/index.cjs:601:31 ]
