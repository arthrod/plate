 * Variant A — CodeRabbit Design Choice 2: footnote definitions stay in the
 * Slate tree so editing/selection/keyboard nav are unaffected, but in-flow
 * appearances are hidden via CSS while the visible representation lives in
 * the per-page footer well painted by `PageFrame`.
 *
 * This component injects the global stylesheet rule that hides
 * footnote-definition blocks from the editor body. The visible copy in the
 * footer well is a snapshot rendered by `PageFrame`; bidirectional editing
 * inside the well is intentionally out of scope for variant A — `print`
 * mode (follow-up) renders real DOM in the well via a `createPortal`.
